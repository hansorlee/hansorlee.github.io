Hello! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Education Data Science at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Ben Domingue](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/bdomingu). I study the gap between what algorithmic systems are designed to do and how they operate in sociotechnical contexts.

My work spans human-AI decision-making, algorithmic fairness, and measurement. I approach these questions from two sides: (1) the deployment side, examining how algorithmic tools reshape human decision-making in practice; and (2) the measurement side, asking whether the models underlying these systems rest on valid empirical foundations. I use methods spanning machine learning, causal inference, and psychometrics.

Before Stanford, I studied Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by Professors [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com/) and [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/). I am a recipient of the [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf) and co-founder of [Learnest](https://www.learnest.org/), a nonprofit to promote responsible AI in education.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

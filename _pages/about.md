Hello! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Education Data Science at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Ben Domingue](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/bdomingu). I received my B.A. and M.S. in Computer Science from Cornell University.

My research draws on psychometrics and machine learning to study how we measure learning and human decision-making, how predictive models shape and are shaped by institutional practices, and how to build AI systems that support these processes in responsible ways. I develop tools and methods that make educational data more interpretable, valid, and useful.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
